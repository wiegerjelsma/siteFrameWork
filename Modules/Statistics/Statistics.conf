/*
De query om de totalen op te halen klopt niet..

Als een bezoeker de 17e en de 18e langskomt, dan is het op de 18e een terugkerende bezoeker.
*/

// Eigenlijk moeten we de visitors veranderen naar de visitorids en de returning en unieke visits veranderen in visitors (dat zijn het namelijk)
// De visits unique, worden niet goed gegroepeerd op applicatie. Ze moeten eerst op applicatie gegroepeerd worden dan op day.. Want als ik nu als zelfde user in de back app ben geweest dan is mijn bezoek aan de front app weg..

Query get returning visitors:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id) as returning_visitors, DATE(datetime) AS day, subdomain, application_name from m_statistics_pageviews GROUP BY visitor_id, day, subdomain, application_name HAVING COUNT(distinct session_id) > 1;
Als ik deze query aanpas naar 'HAVING COUNT(distinct session_id) >= 1' Dan krijg ik niet 2 returning visitors, maar 2 regels als resultaat.. Er moet gegroepeerd worden en opgeteld!
